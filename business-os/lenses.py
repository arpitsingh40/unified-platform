"""Reasoning Lenses — the applied layer of the 20-book decision-science knowledge base.

Each of the 111 dossiers in /app/backend/knowledge/ is distilled here into a compact,
imperative reasoning MODULE. select_lenses() scores modules against the founder's
latest message + situation model and returns the top matches as a prompt block, so
the engine APPLIES frameworks (Munger, Tetlock, Rumelt, Meadows, Klein...) silently
instead of summarizing books. Pure functions, zero LLM cost, ~600 extra tokens/turn max.
